Installation instructions
-------------------------

To install Danger for the Deep on Linux, see the Compiling from Source section

Installing on Windows
---------------------

Version 0.0.18 and newer
------------------------

From version 0.0.18 onwards all needed .dll's are included in the .zip-file.
Just extract it, and run dangerdeep.exe.

Version 0.0.17 and older
------------------------

Earlier versions need the following libraries:

Simple Directmedia Layer (libsdl):
    SDL.dll
SDL Image library (SDL_image):
    SDL_image.dll, libpng.dll, jpeg.dll and zlib.dll
FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West ;) )
    fftw3.dll

Just copy all the DLLs to the folder containing dangerdeep.exe and
double-click dangerdeep.exe to start the game. To run Danger from the
Deep in a different resolution or in windowed mode, see the Command-line
Options section below.


Compiling from Source
---------------------

To compile Danger from the Deep, you will need the SDL, SDL-image, FFTW3
and optionally the SDL-mixer libraries and development packages.

Extract the files using the following command (substitute the name of
the file instead of <file.tar.gz>): tar -zxf <file.tar.gz>
or for .bz2 files: tar -jxf <file.tar.bz2>

Version 0.0.18 and newer
------------------------

You'll need the SCons build system (www.scons.org). It is included in
many distributions, e.g. Debian. It needs Python
(www.python.org). Blender uses it and Doom3/Linux, so it's pretty mature
;-) It has some advantages over automake/autoconf.

Change into the source directory and type the following commands:

	scons -k

That's all. It will make a .tar.gz file containing source and data also.
Copy the contents of the data directoryto a directory named /usr/local/share/dangerdeep
and the dangerdeep binary to /usr/local/bin.
From version 0.0.19 onwards you can run "scons install" as root to install
the game, which is much easier.


Version 0.0.17 and older
------------------------

Change into the source directory and type the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install (you need to be root for this step)

That's all.

Running
-------

To run the game, type 'dangerdeep'. To run Danger from the Deep in a
different resolution or in windowed mode, see the command-line options.
