    * global_data.h:
      - New texture object glasses.

    * global_data.cpp:
      - glasses object is filled.
      
    * submarine.h:
      - New method get_max_depth returns the maximum dive depth of a submarine.
      - New switch for electric engine. This is needed e.g. for detection reasons
        using passive sonar.

    * submarine.cpp:
      - max_submerged_speed is returned when electric engine is activated. max_speed
        else.
    
    * submarine_interface.cpp:
      - Changed the way the rudder works.

	* user_interface.h:
      - New method display_glasses.

 	* user_interface.cpp:
      - When the submarine is on periscope depth and the periscope is up all
        visual contacts are now shown on map.
      - Use y- and x-keys in bridge mode to swap to glasses view.
