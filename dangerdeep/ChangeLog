	* submarine.h, submarine.cpp, submarine_VII.cpp, submarine_XXI.cpp:
	  - New sonar cross section introduced. This factor is needed for active
	    sonar detection, because the visual cross section are (maybe) not
	    appropiate for this.

2003-04-04  Markus Petermann  <m.petermann@gmx.net>

	* ai.cpp:
	  - The attribute attackrun was not initialized. Due to this error the
	    destroyers are immediately in attack mode and do not using their
	    sonar system.

	* sensors.h, sensors.cpp:
	  - New sensor classes that can be used within diverse methods.

	* game.cpp:
	  - The new sensor methods from sensors modul are used.

	* sea_object.h:
	  - A new attribute for all sea_objects storing sensor informations.

	* sea_object.cpp:
	  - New methods to alter sensor informations.

	* ship.cpp, ship_battleshipmalaya.cpp, ship_carrierbogue.cpp,
	  ship_destroyertribal.cpp, ship_mediummerchant.cpp, ship_mediumtroopship.cpp,
	  submarine.cpp, submarine_VIIc.cpp, submarine_XXI.cpp, torpedo.cpp:
	  - New sensors are introduced.

    * sea_object.cpp:
      - Corrected an error in method surface_visibility: A minimum distance of
        0.01 m must be obeyed when calculating the visible profile factor.

    * submarine.cpp:
      - Corrected an error in method surface_visibility: A minimum distance of
        0.01 m must be obeyed when calculating the visible profile factor.

2003-04-01  Markus Petermann  <m.petermann@gmx.net>

    * submarine.cpp:
      - surface_visibility changed: Profile factor is now calculated and used.
      
    * sea_object.cpp:
      - Methods calc_visible_profile_factor and surface_visibility defined.

    * sea_object.h:
      - New attribute cross_section_factor.
      - New methods get_cross_section_factor, calc_visible_profile_factor and
        surface_visibility declared.

    * global_data.h:
      - New texture object glasses.

    * global_data.cpp:
      - glasses object is filled.

    * seaobject.h:
      - New rudder feature added.

    * seaobject.cpp:
      - New rudder feature added.

    * submarine.h:
      - New method get_max_depth returns the maximum dive depth of a submarine.
      - New switch for electric engine. This is needed e.g. for detection reasons
        using passive sonar.
      - snorkel_depth added

    * submarine.cpp:
      - max_submerged_speed is returned when electric engine is activated. max_speed
        else.
      - Electric engine is launched while diving.
    
    * submarine_interface.cpp:
      - Changed the way the rudder works.

    * submarine_interface.h:
      - New method to create a message about the rudder state.

	* user_interface.h:
      - New method display_glasses.

 	* user_interface.cpp:
      - When the submarine is on periscope depth and the periscope is up all
        visual contacts are now shown on map.
      - Use y- and x-keys in bridge mode to swap to glasses view.

	* seaobject.h:
      - New method get_depth added.

	* submarine.h:
      - New attribute periscope_depth.
      - Two new methods get_periscope_depth and is_submerged.

	* submarine.cpp:
      - Changed constructor.

	* submarine_interface.h:
      - Declared some methods virtual.

	* submarine_interface.cpp:
      - Use method get_periscope_depth instead calculating depth everytime
        it is needed.

	* user_interface.h:
      - Definition of constructor user_interface removed.
      - New methods draw_pings, draw_visual_contacts and draw_sound_contacts
        declared.
	  - Declared some methods virtual.

	* user_interface.cpp:
      - Moved constructor user_interface from header file to source file.
      - New methods draw_pings, draw_visual_contacts, draw_sound_contacts
        defined and called from method display_map.
