run "subsim"
(that's all for now)

Gameplay
------------------------------------------------------
The game recommends a resolution of 1024x768 strongly.
It can be played with different resoultions, but will
look ugly. Just type subsim --help and check for
resolution switching. Using a higher resolution is not as
bad as using a smaller, though.
General rule: what does not work that is just not
implemented yet ;-)

Closing words
--------------------------------------------------------
This game is made as tactical simulation that tries to be
as realistic (historical and physical) as possible.
It is NOT meant to glorify war in any form.
Many thousands of people died in the Atlantic during 1939-1945
on both sides.
