Technical Notes
------------------------------------------------------

If you are using a setup with more than one monitor you may experience
problems.

SDL 1.2.11 seems to have problems when running the game on
multimonitor/multihead displays. If you're running the game on a
computer-setup which utilizes more than one screen, you may encounter
problems, for example your X-Session dropping to the Console. In that
case pressing ALT+F7 or ALT+CTRL+F7 might help.

This is no problem with the game, but a problem of the SDL-Framwork
we're using. The SDL-people claim that this issue should be sorted out
in version 2.0 of SDL.

On another note, your graphic-card must at least support OpenGL 1.5 and
even better, OpenGL 2.0 for decent graphics.
Your graphic-card MUST support HARDWARE ACCELERATION.

The game won't run on machines with a Cirrus Logic 4MB card.

We like pie.

Gameplay
------------------------------------------------------
The game recommends a resolution of 1024x768 strongly.
It can be played with different resoultions, but will
look ugly. Just type dangerdeep --help and check for
resolution switching. Using a higher resolution is not as
bad as using a smaller, though.
General rule: what does not work that is just not
implemented yet ;-)

Closing words
--------------------------------------------------------
This game is made as tactical simulation that tries to be
as realistic (historical and physical) as possible.
It is NOT meant to glorify war in any form.
Many thousands of people died in the Atlantic during 1939-1945
on both sides.
