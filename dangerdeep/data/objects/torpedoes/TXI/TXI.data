<!-- For electric torpedos, the speed is fixed, but affected by preheating, so this would be id = 5. A mockup would look like:

  <motion id="5" acceleration="0.85" turnrate="1.0" from="1945/5/1" until="1945/12/31" />

( id=5 for electric torpedos only, and we could add an id=6 or 7 or 8 if TIV and TV, and TXI characteristics require it as well. Therefore, their (TIV, TV, etc..) data files, would have id="5", 6, 7, or whatever, defining their characteristics. -->
  <sensors>
    <sensor type="passivesonar_t11" activation="400"/>
<!-- activate after x meters run lenght -->
<!-- note, sonar activation distance, is independent of torpedo
arming distance, 150m with Pi4c, 400m woth Pi4b (Pi4c+TZ5 coupled).
One way to solve the magnetic pistol issue, would be to add the TZ5 as sensor
characteristic here, not sure if it would work, since it's not a real sensor, it
s a pistol. Magnetic pistols were TZ3, TZ5, TZ6. -->

  <power type="electric" hp="55"/>
<!-- hp value just guessed -->
<!-- data files mention 55hp, value here was 100hp -->
<!-- 
So, the id's are exactly the same as referenced earlier in the motion data mockup, and the power tag mockups would be:

  <power type="electric" id="5" hp="55" from="1945/4/1" until="1945/12/31" />

  <availability date="1945/4/1"/>
<!-- so, no actual combat use made -->
<!-- max rudder turn angle? -->
<!-- default run depth? or run depth range? this seems fixed, 1 to 25 anyway, so i wouldn't bother with this. What changed was later with type XXI, the capability to launch torpedos from much lower depths, up to 50m, but the torpedo run was still made between 1 to 25m. About the boyance (untertrieb), probably i wouldn't bother doing this as well -->
<!-- note: do we add characteristics for LuT runs? primary/secondary -->
