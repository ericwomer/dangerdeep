<!-- For electric torpedos, the speed is fixed, but affected by preheating, so this would be id = 5. A mockup would look like:

  <motion id="5" acceleration="0.85" turnrate="1.0" from="1943/3/1" until="1945/12/31" />

( id=5 for electric torpedos only, and we could add an id=6 or 7 or 8 if TIV and TV, and TXI characteristics require it as well. Therefore, their (TIV, TV, etc..) data files, would have id="5", 6, 7, or whatever, defining their characteristics. -->

<!-- data files mention 32hp, value here was 100hp -->
<!-- 
So, the id's are exactly the same as referenced earlier in the motion data mockup, and the power tag mockups would be:

<!-- max rudder turn angle? -->
<!-- default run depth? or run depth range? this seems fixed, 1 to 25 anyway, so i wouldn't bother with this. What changed was later with type XXI, the capability to launch torpedos from much lower depths, up to 50m, but the torpedo run was still made between 1 to 25m. About the boyance (untertrieb), probably i wouldn't bother doing this as well -->
<!-- note: do we add characteristics for LuT runs? primary/secondary -->
