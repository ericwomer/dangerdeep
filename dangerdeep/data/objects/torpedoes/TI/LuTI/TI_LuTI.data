<!-- hp values specified below, affect acceleration, and therefore turn rate, so, therefore, using a specific speed/range combination, means also using the associated power/rotation value, for instance, 940U/min, which in turn, affects the acceleration value, and the turnrate (acceleration decreases, turn rate increases). On top of this, we have the "from" and "until" values, since speed/range (power output/rotation) changed in the war. So, therefore, we would need to specify a speed/range combination, only 5 combinations possible for TI torpedo > medium speed/range, slow speed/long range, in early war (pre1941), and the fast speed/short range, medium speed/range, slow speed/long range (post1941) - so, id 0 to 4. For electric torpedos, the speed is fixed, but affected by preheating, so this would be id = 5. A mockup would look like:
    <motion id="0" acceleration="0.7" turnrate="1.0" from="1939/1/1" until="1941/1/1" />
  <motion id="1" acceleration="0.8" turnrate="0.9" from="1939/1/1" until="1941/1/1" />
  <motion id="2" acceleration="1.0" turnrate="0.75" from="1941/1/1" until="1945/12/31" />
  <motion id="4" acceleration="0.7 turnrate="1.0" from="1941/1/1" until="1945/12/31" />
  <motion id="5" acceleration="0.85" turnrate="0.85" from="1941/1/1" until="1945/12/31" />

( id=5 for electric torpedos only, and we could add an id=6 or 7 or 8 if TIV and TV, and TXI characteristics require it as well. Therefore, their (TIV, TV, etc..) data files, would have id="5", 6, 7, or whatever, defining their characteristics.

being id="0" the 12500m/30Kn early war, id="1" the 7500m/40Kn early war, id="2" the 6000m/44Kn that was only used in post-1941, the id="3" the 14000m/30Kn (used in post 1941) and the id="4" the 8000m/40Kn, also post-1941. -->

  <power type="steam" hp="70"/>
<!-- hp value just guessed -->
<!-- hp = early war = 108hp at 940U/min, 241hp at 1270U/min, 300hp at 1500U/min, and later war = 255hp at 1280U/min, 350hp at 1470U/min. Therefore, we would also used a from/until tag here, and, associated id tags, just like in the motion tag ids, they're the exact same id's (they define the range/speed combination, according to torpedo type, and date. We don't need rotation tag, it's implicit in the turn rate in the motion).
So, the id's are exactly the same as referenced earlier in the motion data mockup, and the power tag mockups would be:
  <power type="steam" id="0" hp="108" from="1939/1/1" until="1941/1/1" />
  <power type="steam" id="1" hp="241" from="1939/1/1" until="1941/1/1" />
  <power type="steam" id="2" hp="350" from="1941/1/1" until="1945/12/31" />
  <power type="steam" id="3" hp="108" from="1939/1/1" until="1945/12/31" />
  <power type="steam" id="4" hp="255" from="1939/1/1" until="1945/12/31" />
Note: as you can see, different hp values, as you can read in the info tag, and
this explains why different speed/range combinations, as specified in the
motion tag, altough equivalent, but in different periods of war, have different
acceleration values (and as consequence, different turn ratios). -->

<!-- max rudder turn angle? -->
<!-- default run depth? or run depth range? this seems fixed, 1 to 25 anyway, so i wouldn't bother with this. What changed was later with type XXI, the capability to launch torpedos from much lower depths, up to 50m, but the torpedo run was still made between 1 to 25m. About the boyance (untertrieb), probably i wouldn't bother doing this as well -->
<!-- note: do we add characteristics for LuT runs? primary/secondary -->
