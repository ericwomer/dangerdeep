LuT pattern version of TIII G7e ("Lagenunahangiger Torpedo), but instead of using two 13T210 batteries, it used two 17T210 batteries, which gave it a slightly increased range, but, its main difference, is the use of the Pi6 pistol, an improved inertial pistol, and the TZ6 magnetic pistol, based on the TZ5 pistol, which gave it a higher success rate. This unit used a 100hp Siemens GL231/75 electric motor, that drive two contra-rotating propellers. The specified ranges could be reached only if the batteries were preheated to 30'C, however, instead of the 13T210 batteries, this torpedo used two 17T210 batteries, with a larger capacity, of 125Amperes/hour, compared to the previous model capacity, of 93Amperes/hour, which in turn, reflected in an increased range of 7500m at 30Kn, when preheated at 30'C, and 4500m at 28Kn, when not preheated. This torpedo also had a slightly higher warhead, the Kf300, with 300Kg of SW18/36/39/39a mixes. These torpedoes had to be serviced every 3 to 5 days, in order to maintain their reliability.
