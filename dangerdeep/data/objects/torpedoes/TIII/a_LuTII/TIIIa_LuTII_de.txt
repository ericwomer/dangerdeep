LuT pattern version of TIIIa G7e ("Lagenunahangiger Torpedo). This unit used a 100hp Siemens GL231/75 electric motor, that drive two contra-rotating propellers. The above range and speed of 5000m/30Kn could be reached only if the batteries were preheated to 30'C, however, instead of the 13T210 batteries, this torpedo used two 17T210 batteries, with a larger capacity, of 125Amperes/hour, compared to the previous model capacity, of 93Amperes/hour, which in turn, reflected in an increased range of 7500m at 30Kn, when preheated at 30'C, and 4500m at 28Kn, when not preheated. These torpedoes had to be serviced every 3 to 5 days, in order to maintain their reliability. This torpedo used the Pi2 G7H influence pistol.
