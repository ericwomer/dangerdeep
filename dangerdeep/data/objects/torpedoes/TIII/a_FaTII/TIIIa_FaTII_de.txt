FaT stands for Flachenabsuchenden Torpedo, or for Federapparattorpedo. After a primary run of between 1600m to 3200m, if nothing was hit, it would turn 90 or 180 degrees to the left or to the right, and make secondary runs of either 800m or 1600m, until either a target was hit, or batteries were exausted. On the firing of a FaT torpedo, other uboats in the vicinity, had to be warned, otherwise, they would risk being hit by friendly FaT torpedoes, being the standard procedure, to dive to a depth of 50 meters. This unit used a 100hp Siemens GL231/75 electric motor, that drive two contra-rotating propellers. The above range and speed of 5000m/30Kn could be reached only if the batteries were preheated to 30'C, however, instead of the 13T210 batteries, this torpedo used two 17T210 batteries, with a larger capacity, of 125Amperes/hour, compared to the previous model capacity, of 93Amperes/hour, which in turn, reflected in an increased range of 7500m at 30Kn, when preheated at 30'C, and 4500 at 28Kn, when not preheated.	These torpedoes had to be serviced every 3 to 5 days, in order to maintain their reliability. This torpedo used the Pi2 G7H influence pistol.
