<!-- NOTE: we have an issue here: we have 2 alternatives, for pistols. The user
couldn't select them, but torpedoes came with either Pi4b pistol, inertial
pistol, in the back of the homing sensor, that only armed the torpedo at 400m (
the sensor also triggered at 400m), and, the alternative, TV torpedoes with a
Pi4c pistol in the back of the homing sensor AND a TZ5 magnetic pistol, in the 
front, with 2 coils. In this Pi4c+TZ5 configuration, the torpedo armed at 150m, 
however, the homing sensor still triggered at 400m. The advantage of this dual
pistol configuration, in regard to the Pi4b only configuration, is that with the
improved TZ5 magnetic pistols, you could fire a torpedo to run below a target
and then detonate, to break its keel. We therefore need to use an <id> tag in 
the arming, or, easier, to make another TV config, with the Pi4c+TZ5 pistol, and
since user couldn't select pistols, this latest alternative makes more sense.
Should i create another TV ZaukonigI(b) config file, for this pistol config, or
should we specify configs below? I'm not sure this was dependent of period of
war, altough we could fix this now, by simply changing this to a time-dependent
feature. Suggestions needed for this. -->

<!-- we need to specify the TZ5 magnetic too, since it was coupled to Pi4c, for
now, the mock tag:

<!-- For electric torpedos, the speed is fixed, but affected by preheating, so this would be id = 5. A mockup would look like:

  <motion id="5" acceleration="0.85" turnrate="1.0" from="1943/9/1" until="1945/12/31" />

( id=5 for electric torpedos only, and we could add an id=6 or 7 or 8 if TIV and TV, and TXI characteristics require it as well. Therefore, their (TIV, TV, etc..) data files, would have id="5", 6, 7, or whatever, defining their characteristics. -->
  <sensors>
    <sensor type="passivesonar_t5" activation="400"/>
<!-- activate after x meters run lenght -->
<!-- note, sonar activation distance, is independent of torpedo
arming distance, 150m with Pi4c, 400m woth Pi4b (Pi4c+TZ5 coupled).
One way to solve the magnetic pistol issue, would be to add the TZ5 as sensor
characteristic here, not sure if it would work, since it's not a real sensor, it
s a pistol. Magnetic pistols were TZ3, TZ5, TZ6. -->

  <power type="electric" hp="55"/>
<!-- hp value just guessed -->
<!-- data files mention 55hp, value here was 100hp -->
<!-- 
So, the id's are exactly the same as referenced earlier in the motion data mockup, and the power tag mockups would be:

  <power type="electric" id="5" hp="55" from="1943/9/1" until="1945/12/31" />

  <availability date="1943/9/1"/>
<!-- max rudder turn angle? -->
<!-- default run depth? or run depth range? this seems fixed, 1 to 25 anyway, so i wouldn't bother with this. What changed was later with type XXI, the capability to launch torpedos from much lower depths, up to 50m, but the torpedo run was still made between 1 to 25m. About the boyance (untertrieb), probably i wouldn't bother doing this as well -->
<!-- note: do we add characteristics for LuT runs? primary/secondary -->
