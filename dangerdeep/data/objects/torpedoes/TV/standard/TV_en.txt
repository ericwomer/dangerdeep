This torpedo was meant to be used against convoy escorts. Designed to home in on the cavitation noise of around 24.5KHz which was equivalent to the propellers of an escort travelling at 10Kn to 18Kn. The first successful combat use was made in September 1943. The TV ZaukonigI also introduced the TZ5 magnetic pistol, which was basically a metal detector with two coils, and solved much of the problems of early magnetic pistols. An improved TZ6 pistol could be fitted to any G series torpedoes (53.3cm diameter), but was only approved for use as the war ended. Most torpedoes used whisker-type impact pistols, but these could not be used on homing torpedoes. Therefore, these types of torpedoes used an inertial pistol in the rear of the warhead, and the TV ZaukonigI, could use both a magnetic and an inertial impact pistol. The acoustic homing device would only lock to the loudest noise after a run of 400m from its launch, with a Pi4b pistol, and  150m from its launch, with a Pi4c pistol, to avoid locking on the launching uboat. In such cases, standard orders were to dive imediatly to a depth of 60 meters, after launch, if the launch was made from a bow tube. If the launch was made from a stern tube, complete uboat silence was required. Note however, that in a TV Zaukonig, coupled with a Pi4b inertial pistol, in the back of the homing device+warhead, the torpedo arms at 400m, and the sensor device arms at 400m as well. However, by coupling the Pi4c inertial pistol, and the TZ5 magnetic pistol, the torpedo arms after 150m, altough the homing device still arms at 400m, but now the torpedo had the advantage of being able to detonate by sensing a target magnetic field, therefore torpedo would be set to have a run at a greater depth, in order to detonate below the target, and break it's keel. This unit used a 55hp Siemens GL231/55 electric motor, that drove two contra-rotating propellers. The above range and speed of 5750 at 24.5Kn could be reached only if the batteries were preheated to 30'C, however, instead of two 13T210 batteries, this torpedo used one 13T210 battery, which reflected in a range of 5750m at 24.5Kn when preheated, and 3750m/20Kn when not preheated, sacrificing range for speed, since it's primary use was to attack convoy escorts. These torpedoes had to be serviced every 3 to 5 days, in order to maintain their reliability.
