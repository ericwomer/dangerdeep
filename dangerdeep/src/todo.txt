THIS FILE IS FOR SOME SHORT NOTES FROM DEVELOPERS...

Next changes:
-------------

SIMULATE THE PASSIVE SONAR (HEARING EQUIPMENT)
- KGB/GHG/BG machines
- do not call sonar_ships() for each frame that is drawn on the screen,
  but call at once per second or less and store or cache the results.
  Do this for all similar actions. No need to redetect ships 30 or more
  times per second. Once per second is enough. This will lessen CPU usage
  dramatically and we can use more complex algorithms to simulate sensors
  etc., because we can use more costly algos if they're called more seldom.
  Store data in game or per object?
  The data is stored for the player, but there may be multiple players and
  the AI controlled objects may call such functions as well.
  So store the results per object. We do not need to save them to a savegame.
  Cacheable functions: game::visible_*, game::sonar_*, game::radar_*
	DONE, NEXT: do not store pointers per sonar contact (and even radar
	contact?) but only type of signal and direction!
	after that implement sensor classes for kdb/ghg/bg


DAMAGE SIMULATION
- with example data

ACCURATE PHYSICS
