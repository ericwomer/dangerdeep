/*
	fixme: 2004/06/18
	the whole model is slightly wrong. When a plane turns, some speed is lost, but the
	speed doesn't reduce to the part of the old speed vector that is common with the
	new one. E.g. with the old model a turn from north to east (90 degr.) would drop
	the speed to zero, a turn to 60 deg, would have speed, etc. that's not true.
	E.g. a car that turns keeps moving even when changing the direction (without applying
	further force to the wheels).
	So the model would be like this:
	Forces:
	Thrust: along plane's local y-axis.
	Drag: along every axis the plane moves, depends on orientation.
	Lift: along global z-axis, depends on orientation, more precisy along local z-axis!
	Gravity: along global z-axis.
	Speed of the plane is along local y-axis (Mass*velocity = impulse)
	and is not affected by turning (at least not that much).
	The turn rate is influenced by speed and other forces. The more impulse a plane
	has the harder it is to turn (change direction of impulse).
	This has to be modelled with inertia, rotational impulse, torque etc.

	// fixme: the plane's orientation must change with velocity:
	// when rolling the plane to the side, it is lifted hence changing the course.
	// this means that the plane changes its orientation too!
	// according to wind (spatial velocity) it turns its nose!
	// this would explain why the speed drops when making a dive (for now!):
	// the plane can dive at its specific rate no matter how strong the wind resistance
	// is - if the plane would change its orientation with respect to spatial velocity
	// it couldn't turn or dive that fast, allowing the speed to catch up...
