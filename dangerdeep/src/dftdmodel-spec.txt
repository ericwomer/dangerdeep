Structure of DftD-model files
-----------------------------

The Dftd Model files are in XML format, they're sometimes called ddxml
because of this. This file describes their structure and meaning of the
content. It describes version 1.1. 
What is missing is grouping / kinematic tree information. The mesh ids
can be used for this.


Each data file starts with the XML header:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO_8859-1" standalone="yes"?>

The root node of the XML file is a of type "dftd-model". I will now
describe all node types and how they are structured. I'll list all node
types, their possible children nodes and their attributes.

"triple" means triple of value, separated by (white)spaces.  e.g. triple
of float is "x y z", a list of float triples is "x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ..."

Node: dftd-model
================
Root node of the XML model file.

Attributes:
(float) version - version of the model file. For information purposes.

Children: material, mesh, light - Children can appear in any order,
except the following rules: mesh nodes may reference material nodes. A
material node must occour before a reference (an id value) to it
occours.  At least one mesh must be defined.


Node: material
==============
Describes a material.

Attributes:
(string) name - material name for description.
(int) id - number for referencing, must be unique for materials.

Children: diffuse, specular, shininess, map - each node is optional, at
most one of type ambient, diffuse or specular may be defined. At most
one map of each type may be defined.


Node: diffuse
=============
Describes diffuse color.

Attributes:
(triple of float) color - diffuse color. Only used when no diffuse map
given. Also used as ambient color.


Node: specular
==============
Describes specular color.

Attributes:
(triple of float) color - specular color.


Node: shininess
===============
Describes specular shininess (H.N^shininess),
Blinn-phong exponent. Half-angle dot normal will
be powered by this exponent.

Attributes:
(float) exponent - shininess as exponent.


Node: map
=========
Describes a map of the material (sub-property)
The specularmap uses the same transformation as the normal map.

Attributes:
(string) type - can be "diffuse", "normal" or "specular"
(string) filename - any image image containing the map data
(float) uscal - scaling of u coordinates (ignored for specular)
(float) vscal - scaling of v coordinates (ignored for specular)
(float) uoffset - offset of u coordinates (ignored for specular)
(float) voffset - offset of v coordinates (ignored for specular)
(float) angle - rotation angle of u,v coordinates, in ccw direction
                (ignored for specular)


Node: mesh
==========
Describes a mesh of the model.

Attributes:
(string) name - mesh name for description.
(int) id - unique id, not used yet
(int) material - material id to use for this mesh

Children: vertices, indices (both mandatory), texcoords, normals,
transformation (each optional)


Node: vertices
==============
Vertex data for mesh. Mandatory.

Attributes:
(int) nr - number of vertices

Sub-text-node:
(list of triple of float) data


Node: indices
=============
Index data for mesh. Mandatory.

Attributes:
(int) nr - number of indices. Must be multiple of three, because mesh
data are triangles.

Sub-text-node:
(list of triple of float) data


Node: texcoords
===============
Texture coordinate data for mesh. Optional.

Attributes:
none

Sub-text-node:
(list of pair of float) data


Node: normals
=============
Normal data for mesh. Optional.

Attributes:
none

Sub-text-node:
(list of triple of float) data


Node: transformation
====================
Transformation matrix for vertices. Optional.  Sixteen floats in the
following order: row after row, four float values each.

Attributes:
none

Sub-text-node:
(sixteen floats) data


Node: light
===========
Describes a light. Color is the same for ambient, diffuse and specular.

Attributes:
(string) name - descriptive name.
(float triple) pos - light position
(float triple) color - light color
(float) ambient - amount of ambient of light (0...1)


old documentation, example
==========================

XML format.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO_8859-1" standalone="yes"?>

--> Version string is used for information purposes.

<dftd-model version="1.1">

--> A long list with children: materials, meshes and lights, in this order:

--> Materials:

  <material name="Any name you want" id="unique id">

----> can be listed, if not default is 1,1,1  1,1,1  1,1,1 (can change)

diffuse color is used when no diffuse map is given.

    <diffuse color="floatr floatg floatb" />
    <specular color="floatr floatg floatb" />
    <shininess exponent="float" />

----> at most one of each type
----> give u,v scaling and offset and u,v rotation angle. If not given, default values
----> are used. (scal=1.0, offset=0.0, angle=0.0). Give angle in degrees.

can there be no maps? yes...

    <map type="diffuse/normal/specular" filename="foo" uscal="float" vscal="float"
      uoffset="float" voffset="float" angle="float" />

  </material>

--> Meshes:
--> Material id is optional, a default material is used when omitted.

  <mesh name="Any name you want" id="unique id" material="material id">

----> childs in this order:
----> mandatory:

    <vertices nr="(int) nr of vertices">
       ...endless line of floats, divided by (white)spaces, 3x nr in number.
    </vertices>

    <indices nr="(int) nr of indices">
       ...endless line of ints, divided by (white)spaces, 1x nr in number, nr should be
       multiple of three, because we have triangles here.
    </indices>

----> mandatory if material id is given:

    <texcoords>
       ...endless line of floats, divided by (white)spaces, 2x nr of vertices in number.
    </texcoords>

----> optional:

    <normals>
       ...endless line of floats, divided by (white)spaces, 3x nr of vertices in number.
    </normals>

    <transformation>
       ...sixteen floats, forming a transformation matrix for this mesh.
       order is 4x float for first row, 4x float for second row...
    </transformation>

  </mesh>

--> Lights:

  <light name="Any name you want" pos="floatx floaty float z" color="floatr floatg float b"
           ambient="float-amount" />

</dftd-model>

============================================================================================
Changes for Version:
1.1: ambient value per material removed. Ambient color is the same as
     diffuse color, when the latter is used (only when no texture map is
     given).
     Lights have now an ambient value from 0...1. The higher it is the more
     ambient will be in the scene.
     Shininess of material can be given now.
