The first passive homing torpedo. Homing was made by a simple noise measurement. Intended to be used against merchant ships, so the low speed was acceptable. This unit used a 32hp Siemens GL231/35 electric motor, that drive two contra-rotating propellers. The above range and speed of 7500m/20Kn could be reached only if the batteries were preheated to 30'C, however, instead of two 13T210 batteries, this torpedo used one 13T210 battery, which reflected in a range of 7500m at 20Kn when preheated, and 4500m/16Kn when not preheated, however, this was perfectly acceptable for merchant ships. These torpedoes had to be serviced every 3 to 5 days, in order to maintain their reliability. This torpedo used the Pi4a influence pistol.
