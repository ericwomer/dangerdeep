<h2>Version 0.0.12</h2>
<p>Posted by Thorsten Jordan
on 2003-08-05 05:07</p>

<p>a new release that fixes missing images in the data package. 0.0.11 was not playable because of this bug. additionally many new features are available.</p>
<p>problems with the windows version: some keys are not working (unzooming of map etc.) reason is yet unknown.
anyone interested in windows maintainership should mail us.</p>

<h2>Version 0.0.11</h2>
<p>Posted by Thorsten Jordan
on 2003-07-10 05:33</p>

<p>NOTE: 0.0.11 data package was missing some important files! So the game did not work! We hid the release. Please try 0.0.12 instead.</p>
<p>The first release with both, linux and win32, binaries. As always you'll need the data package and the source or linux-bin 
or win32-bin package with an equal version number to run the game. Note that the Win32 version also needs runtime libraries 
(dlls for sdl, sdl_image) available from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">libsdl.org</a>.</p>
<p>The most annoying bugs for win32 are fixed, both versions are functionally equal and compile from the same sources. VC6 project files are available at the CVS repository.</p>

<h2>Win32 Port</h2>
<p>Posted by Thorsten Jordan
on 2003-07-07 04:44</p>

<p>We have begun working on the port to Win32 (VC++6 minimum). It compiles, links and runs but there are still bugs. The mouse pointer is missing on some computers, some keys don't work right. BUT it is playable yet ;-)</p>
<p>File structure:</p>
<p>copy directory data in the same directory as dangerdeep.exe.</p>
<p>To run it, you'll need several DLLs: sdl.dll, sdl_image.dll and its related dll's (jpeg.dll, png.dll, zlib.dll, ...) placed in the same directory as the .exe, . see http://www.libsdl.org for download.</p>
<p>Further you'll need msvcrt.dll and several other vc6 dlls, just search google to quickly find and download them. Maybe this will be fixed in future releases. Maybe we'll make a ready to run win32 release.</p>

<h2>How to create custom missions</h2>
<p>Posted by Thorsten Jordan
on 2003-02-28 05:59</p>

<p>Just add a line in file data/missions/list containing the file name without extension (e.g. "testship") and create a new name in the language files (data/texts/*.text), this is not absolutely neccessary, but without that, you can't read the mission's name in the menu.</p>

<h2>Package versions</h2>
<p>Posted by Thorsten Jordan
on 2003-02-24 00:53</p>

<p>Just to avoid any confusion according the different packages and their versions: you'll need exactly the same version of data and binary package or data and source package. The CVS tree contains source and data, you'll need both when checking out files from cvs.</p>


<h2>Sourcecode available on CVS</h2>
<p>Posted by Thorsten Jordan
on 2003-02-18 00:22</p>

<p>code and data of version 0.0.5 (and newer) is now available at the CVS repository. CVS code may be much newer than releases, e.g. 0.0.10 was months after 0.0.9 with MANY changes.</p>
