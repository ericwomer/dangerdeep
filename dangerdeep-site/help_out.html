		<h2 class="right">Helping out</h2>
		<p>You can help the continual development of Danger from the Deep by contributing some of your time and skill. Listed below are some of the areas that need extra help.</p>
		<h3>Developing</h3>
		<p>Unlike most Open-source simulations/games we don't suffer from a lack of artwork, but from a lack of developers. DftD is primarily written in C++ with OpenGL. Any C or 3D graphic development is useful but the please note that the game is totally object oriented and highly focused on C++, so you will have to learn something about object orientation and C++ (if you don't already).</p>
		<p>Areas of interest are;</p>
		<ul>
			<li>General application development</li>
			<li>3D computer graphics</li>
			<li>Physical simulation</li>
			<li>GUI designers</li>
			<li>Tool-smiths, build system maintenance etc.</li>
			<li>Architect porters ( porting and testing on new architectures, PS3 anyone?)</li>
			<li>Development coordinators, help organise and run the show</li>
		</ul>
		<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=71244">CVS</a> is available, check out the module named dangerdeep</p>
		<h3>2D and 3D artwork</h3>
		<p>At the moment we cannot accept any more artwork, (we're swimming in it) and development needs a few months to catch up, but if you're willing to help, but have no coding experience, there are several ways you can help.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating historical accurate models of ships, submarines, airplanes, etc.</li>
			<li>Designing damage model data for afore mentioned 3D models</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It would be a very good idea to discuss any plans in the <a href="http://www.dangerdeep.net/forums/">forum</a> before starting on anything.</p>
		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>Testing is a very important part of software development. Simply trying out the latest version from CVS and reporting any issues is a big help as system configuration of both hardware and software vary dramatically.</p>
		<h3>Package maintainers</h3>
		<p>Can't find a package available for your distribution of Linux or BSD? Well, now's your chance to create one.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The construction of installers (Windows et al)</li>
			<li>Compiling releases for Windows</li>
			<li>Binary distributions for Linux (rpm/deb/etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Historical researchers</h3>
		<p>Our aim is to make a historically accurate simulation, as realistic as our skill and time allows on current hardware. You can help us by finding and verifying that our information is accurate by cross-checking with multiple sources. Unfortunately with the prevalence of disinformation on the Internet this task is becoming harder and more difficult. Any of the following is highly desired;</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Data on ships, submarines, airplanes, bunkers, weapons, etc.</li>
			<li>Blue prints on any of the above</li>
			<li>Data about convoy routes and how and when convoys were organised</li>
			<li>Information on machines or technology like; Radar, Sonar, Torpedo data computers or weapon control etc.</li>
			<li>Historical maps and plans that can be used as source of information or re-used for graphics.</li>
			<li>Please note that this is an open-source game and all information should be freely available (public domain etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Sound technicians and musicians</h3>
		<p>Ever seen a submarine powered by a washing machine? Well you have now! Creating sound effects really brings a game to life and they can come from the most boring everyday things</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The recording/creation of sound effects</li>
			<li>The processing and encoding of sound effects</li>
			<li>Composition or creation of soundtracks</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Manual writers</h3>
		<p>Creating, updating and maintaining a manual is a most important task, not many people can remember all the key bindings or how to articulate a certain part of the simulation. This is where manuals really shine, being able to give the user the information they need with the minimum amount of time wasted.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quick-start, all the basic information needed to get going</li>
			<li>Comprehensive, containing anything and everything to do with; Game play, instrument operation, tactics and everything else that's been forgotten</li>
			<li>Ideally in a free format (Scribus, HTML, PDF, OpenOffice documents, TeX and the like)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Website maintainers and web designers</h3>
		<p>I think we have this covered for the moment, but if you have any suggestions or improvements then please don't hesitate to contact us</p>
		<h3>Translators</h3>
		<p>Danger from the deep is a multi-lingual game. If you would like to see the game in your language and can help us out with any of the following</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Translate current texts to new languages</li>
			<li>Manage and adapt texts when it is necessary (texts changed, new release)</li>
			<li>Take over existing translations and maintain them</li>
			<li>Possible translation of the website</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Final words</h3>
		<p>Phew! What a big list, you should note that it is not inclusive, if you feel that you have a contribution that you want to make then please contact us.</p>
